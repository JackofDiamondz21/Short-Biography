		<h2>Favorite childhood memory</h2>
			<p> My favorite childhood memory is when i got my first video game being Pokemon platnium for the DS for christmas in 2009.
			 I loved playing the game and later got into other games like the many mario series and later messed around with other consoles like the playstaion 2 and Xbox 360.
			  But overall the pokemon series are still one of my favorites and i continue playing even today.
			   This is also probably why i want to design and make video games.</p>
			<p> favorite childhood memory is when my freind Stephen ask me to come with him to Georgia for a week during our spring break.
			 When we got there we messed around at the beach. we ate great food and got to see a lot of new things.
			  Then when it got dark we stayed in the hotel room and played video games like minecraft and Spore and had a lot of fun. </p>
		<h2>School History</h2>
				<p>There is not much to talk about my school history other than i moved from Illinois in the middle of 8th grade and went from Westfielf community school to Preston middle school.
					 Later i went to highschool at Fossil Ridge and graduated in 2019.
					  Now im here learning coding, animation and graphics and plan to head to another college to learn more about making video games</p>
		<h2>Favorite Color</h2>
				<p>My favorite color is red and it is probably because of the impact video games had on me growing up.
					The reason why is because of my few first video games mario and my first pokemon Chimchar are both red characters that can use the power of fire.</p>
